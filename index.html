    <h2>Fighting inequality for a resilient future</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">This year's World Tsunami Awareness Day theme, "Fighting Inequality for a Resilient Future," raises awareness 
      of the unequal risks that tsunamis pose, especially to vulnerable groups like women, children, the elderly, and
      people with disabilities. In the past century, tsunamis have claimed over 260,000 lives, leaving a deadly legacy 
      despite their rarity. This startling statistic—which shows an average of 4,600 fatalities each disaster—beyonds the 
      effects of any other natural hazard and emphasizes the need for proactive steps to reduce risks and improve community
      readiness.</p><br>
    <p id="paragraph">Raising public awareness of the necessity of lowering tsunami dangers is the main goal of World Tsunami Awareness Day.
      The campaign, which is in line with the International Day for Disaster Reduction, highlights the necessity of group
      participation in disaster risk reduction initiatives from all societal sectors. The selected theme emphasizes how
      important it is to reduce injustice and develop tsunami resilience. In order to ensure a coordinated effort to lessen
      the effects of these uncommon but devastating natural disasters, the initiative seeks to build a more resilient and
      responsive foundation for communities through collaboration. QuillBot's paraphrasing tool takes your sentences and makes

    <p id="paragraph">The call to action is underscored by the gravity of the statistics, compelling society to recognize the severity of
the threat posed by tsunamis and to unite in a concerted effort to forge a more resilient future. Through awareness,
collaboration, and preparedness, it becomes possible to mitigate the consequences of these rare but potent natural events
and create a safer environment for all.</p>
